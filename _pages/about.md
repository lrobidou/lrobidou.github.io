I am a french PhD student at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en), in [Rennes](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-centre-rennes-university) University. I am in the [GenSacle](https://team.inria.fr/genscale/) team under [Pierre Peterlongo](https://people.rennes.inria.fr/Pierre.Peterlongo/)'s supervision. I started my PhD in October 2020. 

Research topics
======
Currently, there is no method able to index the huge number of DNA datasets publicly available. My research focuses on indexing those publicly available DNA sequences. Existing indexes may yields false positives. We developed a method to improve existing index on the fly. We reduce the number of false positives by two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, our methods allows querying improved indexes faster than their original counterpart.
