I am a french PhD student at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en), in [Rennes](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-centre-rennes-university) University. I started my PhD in October 2020, in the [GenSacle](https://team.inria.fr/genscale/) team under [Pierre Peterlongo](https://people.rennes.inria.fr/Pierre.Peterlongo/)'s supervision.

Research topics
======
I am currently interested in algorithms and datastructures for indexing DNA sequences.

Currently, there is no search engine able to search among the huge number of DNA datasets publicly available. My research focuses on indexing those publicly available DNA sequences to build such search engine.
Since existing indexes may yields false positives, we developed a method to improve them on the fly, reducing the number of false positives and allowing faster queries.
