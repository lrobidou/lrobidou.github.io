I am a French CNRS engineer working in:
- the SSFA team, at [I2BC](https://www.i2bc.paris-saclay.fr/) in Gif-sur-Yvette
- the [Bonsai](https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr/bonsai/) team in Lille

Prior to that, I completed my Ph.D. at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en), in [Rennes](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-centre-rennes-university) University, within the [GenScale](https://team.inria.fr/genscale/) team under the supervision of [Pierre Peterlongo](https://people.rennes.inria.fr/Pierre.Peterlongo/).

I also held a postdoctoral position in the [Genome Informatics](https://gi.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/) at Bielefeld University.

Research topics
======
I am interested in algorithms and datastructures for indexing DNA sequences.

During my thesis, I worked on improving search engines to search among the huge number of DNA datasets publicly available. Since existing indexes may yield false positives, we developed a method to improve them on the fly, reducing the number of false positives and allowing faster queries.

During my postdoc, I worked on reducing the size of datastructures representing sets of k-mers.
